//! Client activity trace: what the browser sees and the API does not.
//!
//! **Why this exists, and it is not analytics.** The per-request trace already
//! logs every API call, and that is not sufficient: a tap that hit a disabled
//! control, a filter that quietly matched nothing, a move that never fired —
//! none of it reaches the server, so none of it can be diagnosed afterwards from
//! a report like "I pressed it and nothing happened". This app is used from a
//! phone, where that report is the only one there is.
//!
//! The events fold into the **same** log stream as the API requests, so a
//! session reads as one timeline: `client-event kind=nav path=/graph`, then
//! `client-event kind=tap label="project_dev_lint"`, then the
//! `GET /api/memory/... 200` the tap caused.
//!
//! **There is no storage here.** These are logs, not data. The endpoint moves
//! the client's events into the backend log and forgets them.
//!
//! Copied from memview's, which was ported from `fleetwatch`, which took it
//! from `life`. The one part worth reading before changing anything is
//! [`one_line`]: it is the security boundary, and it is the same everywhere.
